# Llane UI Framework

Llanne UI is an open-source project, ready-to-use React.js components library that facilitates the development of React.js frontend applications and websites natively compatible with mobile device screens. The idea of developing a standard UI framework for React.js and TypeScript comes from my own need for standardising UI components across different applications I am working on for consistent cross-platform UI/UX and an efficient way to update multiple frontend UIs all at once.
